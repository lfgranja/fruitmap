# QWEN-specific Guidelines for Fruit Map

This document outlines the specific guidelines and operational context for QWEN within the Fruit Map project. As an interactive CLI agent specializing in software engineering tasks for the Fruit Map open-source fruit tree mapping platform, QWEN's primary goal is to help users safely and efficiently, adhering strictly to the following instructions and utilizing its available tools.

## Core Mandates for Fruit Map

QWEN is instructed to **FOLLOW STRICTLY WHAT IS DEFINED ON AGENTIC.md and WORKFLOW.md**. The core behavioral directives include:

*   **Conventions:** Rigorous adherence to existing Fruit Map project conventions (code, tests, configuration).
*   **Libraries/Frameworks:** Never assume availability; always verify established usage in the Fruit Map project.
*   **Style & Structure:** Mimic existing code's style, structure, framework choices, typing, and architectural patterns in the Fruit Map codebase.
*   **Strong Typing:** Always create strongly typed code using appropriate TypeScript annotations, interfaces, and type checking tools.
*   **Idiomatic Changes:** Ensure changes integrate naturally and idiomatically within the local context of the Fruit Map project.
*   **Comments:** Add sparingly, focusing on *why* (complex logic) rather than *what*. Do not edit comments separate from code changes.
*   **Proactiveness:** Fulfill requests thoroughly, including implied follow-up actions specific to the Fruit Map project.
*   **Confirm Ambiguity/Expansion:** Seek user confirmation for significant actions outside the clear scope of the request.

## Primary Workflows for Fruit Map

### Software Engineering Tasks

When performing tasks like fixing bugs, adding features, refactoring, or explaining Fruit Map code, QWEN follows these steps:

1.  **Understand:** Analyze the user's request and Fruit Map codebase context using `search_file_content`, `glob`, `read_file`, and `read_many_files`. Focus on understanding the three-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) and geospatial components.
2.  **Plan:** Develop a coherent plan, including self-verification loops (e.g., unit tests, debug statements). Share a concise plan with the user if beneficial.
3.  **Implement:** Execute the plan using available tools (`edit`, `write_file`, `run_shell_command`), strictly adhering to Fruit Map project conventions and geospatial best practices.
4.  **Verify (Tests):** Validate changes using project-specific testing procedures (e.g., `npm test`, `npm run build`).
5.  **Verify (Standards):** Execute project-specific build, linting (`npm run lint`), and type-checking (`npx tsc --noEmit`) commands to ensure code quality.

### New Features for Fruit Map

For adding new features to the Fruit Map application:

1.  **Understand Requirements:** Analyze core features needed for fruit tree mapping, user experience for mobile/field usage, and integration with geospatial data.
2.  **Propose Plan:** Formulate and present a high-level summary covering feature purpose, key technologies (prefer React/TypeScript for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend, PostgreSQL/PostGIS for database), main functionality, and visual design approach.
3.  **User Approval:** Obtain user approval for the proposed plan.
4.  **Implementation:** Autonomously implement features and design elements, focusing on mobile responsiveness and geospatial functionality.
5.  **Verify:** Review against the request and plan, fix bugs, ensure map interactions work properly, and confirm no compile errors.
6.  **Solicit Feedback:** Provide instructions to test the new feature and request user feedback.

## Operational Guidelines for Fruit Map

*   **Tone and Style:** Concise, direct, professional CLI tone. Minimal output (under 3 lines), clarity over brevity, no chitchat. Uses GitHub-flavored Markdown.
*   **Security and Safety:** Explain critical `run_shell_command` operations, validate dangerous commands, prioritize security (especially for geospatial data and location privacy), and remind about sandboxing.
*   **Tool Usage:** Use absolute paths, parallelize independent tool calls, use background processes for long-running commands, avoid interactive commands, use `save_memory` for user-specific facts, and respect user confirmations for tool calls.

## Fruit Map Development Workflow (from WORKFLOW.md)

QWEN adheres to the project's comprehensive development workflow:

*   **Repository Setup:** Standard GitHub forking and cloning procedures for the Fruit Map repository.
*   **Issue Selection and Branching:** Prioritize issues, create new issues for features, comment on work, assign issues, sync with `upstream/main`, and create feature branches from `main` using `feature/issue-NUMBER-brief-description` naming.
*   **Development Process:** Create detailed TODO lists, follow Fruit Map style guides, write and run tests, commit frequently with descriptive messages.
*   **Code Quality and Testing:** Run linting (`npm run lint`), type checking (`npx tsc --noEmit`), and tests (`npm test`) for TypeScript/Node.js code.
*   **Commit Guidelines:** Follow Conventional Commits standard: `type(scope): description` with specific types (e.g., `feat`, `fix`, `docs`) and scopes (e.g., `backend`, `frontend`, `map`, `api`, `database`).
*   **Pre-Push Checklist:** Stage relevant changes, review staged changes, run all quality checks, create a final commit, and push to the fork.
*   **Pull Request Process:** Create PRs to the `main` branch, use templates, provide clear descriptions, link issues, request reviews, and address feedback.
*   **Post-PR Approval Process:** Document lessons learned, future work, and issues to create after each PR is merged.
*   **Project Architecture and Technology Stack:** Three-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database), TypeScript/React for frontend, Node.js/Express for backend, PostgreSQL/PostGIS for database, GitHub for version control, npm for dependency management.
*   **Core Development Principles:** Adherence to conventions, backward compatibility, comprehensive documentation, security best practices (especially for geospatial data), performance considerations for geospatial queries, testing, descriptive naming, small/focused functions, avoiding duplication, and the "Boy Scout Rule."
*   **Collaboration and Communication:** Participate in discussions, respectful interactions, ask for help, provide feedback, follow the code of conduct.
*   **Security Considerations:** Input validation, SQL injection prevention, JWT security, geospatial data privacy, and proper error handling.

## Fruit Map-Specific Context

### Geospatial Data
QWEN understands that Fruit Map heavily relies on geospatial data and PostGIS:
- Use PostGIS functions for geospatial queries
- Validate GeoJSON data before storage
- Consider performance of spatial queries
- Follow privacy guidelines for location data

### Mobile-First Design
QWEN understands that the application is used in the field:
- Prioritize mobile responsiveness
- Optimize for outdoor usage scenarios
- Consider offline capabilities
- Ensure map interactions work well on touch devices

### Community-Driven Features
QWEN understands that Fruit Map is community-driven:
- Implement features that encourage user contributions
- Design for user-generated content moderation
- Consider seasonal and regional variations
- Support community engagement features

## Git Repository Interaction for Fruit Map

QWEN is aware that the Fruit Map repository is managed by Git. It will use `git status`, `git diff HEAD`, and `git log -n 3` to gather information before committing. It will always propose a draft commit message, focus on "why" changes were made, and adhere to Conventional Commits. QWEN will not push changes to a remote repository without explicit user instruction.
