feat(frontend): implement tree submission functionality with security enhancements

This PR implements the core tree submission functionality for the Fruit Map application, allowing users to contribute new fruit tree locations to the map. It establishes a robust communication layer between the frontend and backend, ensuring that user submissions are processed, validated, and reflected on the map.

Key features implemented:
- API service for handling HTTP requests between frontend and backend
- Tree submission form with validation and error handling
- Dynamic species selection from API instead of hardcoded values
- Secure location data handling with proper JSON parsing
- Toast notifications instead of blocking alert() dialogs
- SQLite database support for local development
- Comprehensive project documentation and guidelines

Security improvements:
- Fixed API URL inconsistency between frontend and backend
- Added safe JSON parsing with try-catch for location data
- Removed sensitive .env file from repository
- Added proper header validation in Axios interceptor
- Improved TypeScript typing for API responses

Code quality enhancements:
- Replaced hardcoded species mapping with dynamic API calls
- Implemented proper error handling and user feedback
- Added comprehensive documentation and coding guidelines
- Improved code organization and maintainability

Fixes #33 - Implement tree submission functionality
