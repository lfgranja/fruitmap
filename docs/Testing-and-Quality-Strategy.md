# Testing and Quality Strategy - Fruit Map

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive testing and quality assurance strategy for the Fruit Map application. The strategy ensures high-quality, reliable, and maintainable software through a layered testing approach and quality practices.

## Testing Philosophy
- Test early and often in the development process

**Performance Testing:**
- Lighthouse performance scores >80 for all metrics
- Mobile performance testing on various devices
- Network condition testing (3G, 4G, WiFi)
- Load testing with realistic user scenarios

### Accessibility Standards
**Compliance Level:** WCAG 2.1 AA
**Tools:**
- axe-core for automated accessibility testing
- Lighthouse accessibility audits
- Manual testing with screen readers

**Requirements:**
- All functionality accessible via keyboard
- Proper heading structure
- Sufficient color contrast ratios
- Alternative text for images
- ARIA labels where necessary

### Security Standards
**Testing Focus:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Authentication and authorization
- Data privacy and protection
- Secure communication (HTTPS)
- Rate limiting and DoS protection

**Tools:**
- OWASP ZAP for security scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Static code analysis for security issues
- Penetration testing for critical features

## Testing Environments

### Development Environment
- Local development with mocked external services
- Fast feedback loops for unit and integration tests
- Component development with Storybook
- Continuous testing during development

### Testing Environment
- Staging environment matching production
- Full test suite execution
- Database reset for each test run
- External service mocking for reliability

### Production Monitoring
- Real user monitoring

## Test Automation Strategy

### Continuous Integration Pipeline
```
Code Commit
├── Pre-commit hooks (linting, formatting)
├── Unit tests (fast feedback)
├── Integration tests
├── Security scanning
├── Code coverage check (>80% for critical paths)
├── Build verification
└── Deployment to staging
```

### Test Execution Priorities
1. **Fast feedback:** Unit tests run on every commit
2. **Pre-merge:** Unit + Integration tests pass before merge
