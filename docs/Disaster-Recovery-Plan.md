## Recovery Procedures

### Immediate Response (0-30 minutes)

#### Step 1: Incident Detection and Assessment
1. Monitor system status through automated alerts
2. Confirm the nature and scope of the incident
3. Activate incident response team
4. Establish communication channels
5. Document incident details

#### Step 2: Initial Response Actions
1. Implement immediate containment measures
2. Preserve evidence and system state
3. Notify key stakeholders
4. Assess impact on users and services
5. Activate disaster recovery plan

### Short-term Recovery (30 minutes - 4 hours)

#### Step 3: Service Restoration
**For Application Server Failure:**
1. Switch to backup application servers
2. Verify application functionality
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Implement temporary capacity increases if needed

**For Database Outage:**
1. Restore from latest backup
2. Apply transaction logs to minimize data loss
3. Verify data integrity
4. Redirect application to restored database

**For Infrastructure Outage:**
1. Activate failover systems in alternative region
2. Update DNS records if necessary
3. Verify service functionality
4. Monitor user access and performance

### Long-term Recovery (4-24 hours)

#### Step 4: Complete System Restoration
1. Restore primary systems when conditions allow
2. Migrate data and configurations
3. Validate all system functions
4. Conduct performance testing
5. Verify data consistency

#### Step 5: Service Verification
1. Test all critical user workflows
2. Validate data integrity
3. Confirm security controls
4. Verify backup systems are operational
5. Document lessons learned
